# Airport Jam

A "game" made while waiting on a delayed flight out of Detroit. Written in Swift using SpriteKit. Win the game by adding enough spinning squares to the screen to drop the FPS down to the lowest value you have the patience for.

The goals for this project were a low-overhead Swift app using SpriteKit with a focus on functional programming. This approach caused some bumps in the road, but the final codebase is very simple and easy to understand.
